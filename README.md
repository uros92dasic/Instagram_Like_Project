# InstagramLikeProject - Laravel
You can login using:
Email: "test@test.com"
Pass: "1234567890"

You will be redirected to: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".
Go to: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/1" where you can edit the profile, or you can simply click on any of the posts on the first page.

In case you register as a new user, and there are no posts showing, that is because you are not "following" anyone.
Go to: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/1" and follow that test user and the test user posts will be shown at the page before.

Go to: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/2" to edit your profile and/or add posts.

I am aware that there could be couple of extra buttons or redirections for all of this to work nicely, but it was a fast project where I wanted to learn some basics of Laravel.
